All components in the system is another (less useful) heuristic. Probabilistic mode estimation uses conflicts in order to generate the best possible guess about the health of all the components, if conflicts aren't particularly minimal (in the worst case, if they involve all components) Probabilistic Mode Estimation will only enumerate the failure space in a-priori failure probability order. So, it's not wrong to poorly minimize conflicts, it just makes probabilistic mode estimation perform poorly.   "
