    "A critical attribute of a well-design complex system is the ability for it to detect, diagnose, and recover from off-nominal conditions, such as component failures or unexpected sensor readings.  In many situations (deep space probes, autonomous undersea vehicles) there is no potential for human intervention to help diagnose or reconfigure the system; that process must be able to happen automatically.  This notebook describes the elements of model-based reasoning, which is one powerful way for systems to reason about, and correct for, any failures that occur.  The basic idea is that the system compares observations of it's behavior to a model which predicts what the behavior should be, given the current state of the system.  If there is a discrepancy, logical inference is used to determine the most likely causes.  This note book describes the fundamental rules of logical inference, the process by which logical reasoning takes place, and the mechanics of how the system checks for conflicts and determines likely failures.

    "Propositional logic is a formal language that is used to represent information, in order to reason about the truth and implications of various statements.  The basic element of this language is a **proposition**, which is a simple true or false statement, or equivallently an assignment to one of the domain variables that make up the system being modeled. Logical **sentences** are created by combining propositions using various boolean operators.  The three fundamental boolean operators are **and**, **or**, and **not**.

For example, suppose we don't observe any thrust on the thrust sensor (S1 = False or ~S1), even though our current model implies that it should be there (S1 = True, or S1). We would like to reason about what are the most likely failed components in our system.\n",

Each mode variable X represents the functioning of a component, and can be assigned either Good or Unknown.  In our spaceship example, the variabels A1-A7, R1, and C1-C2 are the mode variables.  An assignment of True indicates a working component, and 0 indicates a component in the unknown state.In consistency-based diagnosis, there are no assumptions that need be made about how a component fails. \n",

This is a mode assignment to the system that, for the same set of inputs as a conflict, removes the logical inconsistency with the observations. For example, if components A1-A3 being good (A1-A3=1) are inconsistent with some observations, then A1-A3=0 is a valid diagnosis if removing the constraints associated with those components eliminates the inconsistency with the observations. \n",

    "  Usually you'll want to iterate through your resolutions in probability order, given a prior probability of component failure.\n",
